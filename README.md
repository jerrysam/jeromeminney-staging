## User testing notes

### User testing with JBS
  Didn't press spacebar, scrolled down immediately.
    JBS felt the spacebar thing should me much more eye-catching
  JBS commented that the flow could be optimised (but we know that's gonna need loads of tweaking)
  The line about education didn't feel relevant
  JBS didn't know what to do at the end of the story
    technology | commercial | business - looks like links to scroll down the page

  I think I should change "small" to "little" so that it's not compared with "big"

  JBS felt that the text / claims need more backing & numbers to prove my ability. Specifically:
    starting tech companies (companies started), speaking engagements (videos or list of talks), business consultancy (what type?)
  Overall, JBS wants more of the website to jump out at him. He wants easter eggs and gifts and wow/pazazz, etc

  <!--DONE: Perhaps the final spacebar press should scroll the user to the next section -->

### User testing with San
  First line (press spacebar to continue) should fade in or show interactivity/animation
  The first line is too small, the rest are too large.. get them both in the middle
  From "yes I coded this animation myself", it sounds kinda pretentious, and the story frazzles out for all future lines from there.

### Jerome's notes / ideas
  Go back to your mantra's. You know, "open every door and go down the path of least resistance", "the theory of relative success", "no one knows anything about anything", "It's not about achieving your goal, it's about enjoying the journey"
